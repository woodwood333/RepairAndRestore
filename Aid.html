                When using formatted design/classification 
                applied on a great number of props, it is nice to 
                keep untight things sometime, an info box a bit loose
                in the determination of its content, some pictures that 
                lack severe systematisation protocol or appearance, or 
                hazy and fluctuating naming convention that adapts to 
                the object are nice cause they keep the visitor surprised 
                and entertained, leave it a space to wonder in a rational 
                env, making it even more efficient as triggering memory. 
                It a bet, sacrificing a bit of clarity for a bit of memory. 
                Using EselBridge and such.
